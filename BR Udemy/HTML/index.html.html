<p5><b>Ah, yeah</b><br>
Hey!<br>
<i>Now, nothing ever last forever, no <br>
One minute you're here and the next you're gone <br>
So I respect you, wanna take it slow <br>
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe <br>
Do you mind if I steal a kiss, tho? (Chop, chop) <br>
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?<br>
To memorize the way you shock me <br>
The way you move it here (hey)<br>
Just wanna feel it from you (hey)<br>
Don't be afraid to catch feels <br>
Ride drop top and chase thrills (hey)<br>
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (hey)<br>
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels <br>
Feels with me <br>
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh <br>
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality <br>
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar<br>
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity<br>
Do you mind if I steal a kiss, tho? (Chop, chop)<br>
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)<br>
To memorize the way you shock me (yeah)<br>
The way you move it here (hey)<br>
Just wanna feel it from you (hey)<br>
Don't be afraid to catch feels (ha)<br>
Ride drop top and chase thrills (oh-oh-oh, oh)<br>
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (hey)<br>
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (straight up)<br>
Feels with me (woah)<br>
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance (babe)<br>
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention? (Like, woah)<br>
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions<br>
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance (yeah, yeah)<br>
She's looking for a little more consistency (I know)<br>
But when you stop looking, you gon' find what's meant to be<br>
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes (no)<br>
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's<br>
I feel my old flings was just preparing me (me)<br>
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet (par')<br>
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb (woah)<br>
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me (woah)<br>
I'ma at this at you, if I put you on my phone (woah)<br>
And upload it, it'll get maximum views<br>
I came in through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones<br>
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone<br>
Don't be afraid to catch feels (ha)<br>
(Don't be afraid to catch these feels)<br>
Ride drop top and chase thrills (yeah)<br>
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)<br>
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)<br>
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels<br>
(Woah, woah, woah)<br>
Feels with me<br>
Don't be afraid to catch feels (no, no)<br>
Don't be afraid, baby<br>
Don't be afraid<br>
Ride drop top and chase thrills (woah, okay)<br>
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills<br>
I know, I know, I know<br>
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels<br>
Feels with me</i></p5>
